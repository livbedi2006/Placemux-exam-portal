A simple ADAPTIVE TEST SIMULATOR.

No ML here -- this is rule-based logic:
  - Start the student at a middle difficulty band.
  - After each answer: correct -> move up one band, wrong -> move down one band.
  - Pick the next unseen question from that band (optionally filtered by domain).
  - A fixed number of Aptitude questions are mixed into every test, at random
    positions, while still following the same adaptive difficulty logic.

Run with: python recommend.py
